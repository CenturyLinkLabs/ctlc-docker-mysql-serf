ctlc-docker-mysql
==================

Base docker image to run a MySQL database server


Usage
-----

To create the image `ctlc/mysql`, execute the following command on the ctlc-mysql folder:

	sudo docker build -t ctlc/mysql .

The first time that you run your container, a new user `admin` with all privileges 
will be created in MySQL with a random password. To get the password, check the logs
of the container by running:

	sudo docker logs $CONTAINER_ID

You will see an output like the following:

	========================================================================
	You can now connect to this MySQL Server using:

	    mysql -uadmin -p47nnf4FweaKu -h<host> -P<port>

	Please remember to change the above password as soon as possible!
	MySQL user 'root' has no password but only allows local connections
	========================================================================

In this case, `47nnf4FweaKu` is the password allocated to the `admin` user. To get
the allocated port to MySQL, execute:

	sudo docker port $CONTAINER_ID 3306

It will print the allocated port (like 4751). You can then connect to MySQL:

	 mysql -uadmin -p47nnf4FweaKu -h127.0.0.1 -P4751

Remember that the `root` user has no password but it's only accesible from within the container.


Mounting the database file volume
---------------------------------

In order to persist the database data, you can mount a local folder from the host on the container to store the database files. To do so:

	$ID=$(sudo docker run -d -v /path/in/host:/var/lib/mysql ctlc/mysql-php /bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/mysql_install_db")

This will mount the local folder `/path/in/host` inside the docker in `/var/lib/mysql` (where MySQL will store the database files by default). `mysql_install_db` creates the initial database structure.

Remember that this will mean that your host must have `/path/in/host` available when you run your docker image!


Initializing the server
-----------------------

To set your initial root password, run:

	ID=$(sudo docker run -d ctlc/mysql /bin/bash -c "/set_root_pw.sh <newpassword>")

Where `<newpassword>` is the password to be set for the root account. It will store the new container ID (like `d35bf1374e88`) in $ID. To create an image from that, execute:

	sudo docker commit $ID ctlc/my-mysql-server

To import a SQL backup which is stored for example in the folder `/tmp/sqlbackup` in the host, run the following:

	ID=$(sudo docker run -d -v /tmp/sqlbackup:/tmp ctlc/my-mysql-server /bin/bash -c "/import_sql.sh <rootpassword> /tmp/<dump.sql>")

Where `<rootpassword>` is the root password set earlier and `<dump.sql>` is the name of the SQL file to be imported.

You can now push your changes to the registry:

	sudo docker push ctlc/my-mysql-server


Migrating an existing MySQL Server
----------------------------------

In order to migrate your current MySQL server to a docker, perform the following commands from your current server:

To dump your databases structure:

	mysqldump -u<user> -p --opt -d -B <database(s)> > dbserver_schema.sql

To dump your database data:

	mysqldump -u<user> -p --quick --single-transaction -t -n -B <database(s) > dbserver_data.sql


Running the MySQL server
------------------------

Run the `/run.sh` script to start MySQL (via supervisor):

	ID=$(sudo docker run -d -p 3306 ctlc/my-mysql-server /run.sh)


It will store the new container ID (like `d35bf1374e88`) in $ID. Get the allocated external port:

	sudo docker port $ID 3306


It will print the allocated port (like 4751). Test your deployment:

	mysql -uroot -p -h127.0.0.1 -P4751

Done!
